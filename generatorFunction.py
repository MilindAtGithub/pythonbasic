# This is the generator function which work like stream
# We are going to use Yield which has the following fucntionality
    # The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to caller,
    # but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed,
    # the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run.
    # This allows its code to produce a series of values over time,
    # rather them computing them at once and sending them back like a list.
